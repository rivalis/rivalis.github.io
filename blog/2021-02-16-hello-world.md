Hi,

Thanks for visitng the website of my hobby project.
I'm proud to announce initial version of my project Rivalis, an open source multiplayer server.

## About me
Software developer @ [Keitaro](https://keitaro.com), open source developer in my free time, passionate for learning everything that is related to computer science. 

## Why Rivalis?
Before few months I started learning distributed systems. That time the idea for Rivalis comes to my mind.

My goal is to develop framework for building protocol agnostic and distributed game servers. Framework shall be extensible, easy to use and provide event ordering mechanism out of the box.
